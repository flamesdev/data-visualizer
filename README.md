The country and continent population data originates from [Worldometer's population counter](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population).
The religion population data is from a [2015 projection by Pew Research Center](https://www.pewforum.org/2017/04/05/the-changing-global-religious-landscape).
The GDP data originates from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org)'s nominal and per capita GDP data from 2017.
The flag icons are inspired by [Emojious's flag icon collection](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/flags-37).
Many of the icons have been created or altered by [@zznith](https://github.com/zznith) and I.
