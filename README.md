A visualization of varying datasets.
The country and continent population data originates from [Worldometer's population counter](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population).
The religion population data is based on a [2010 study by Pew Research Center](https://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-unaffiliated).
The GDP data originates from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org)'s nominal GDP data from 2017.
The flag icons are inspired by [Emojious's flag icon collection](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/flags-37).
Many of the icons have been created or altered by @Zenster and I.
