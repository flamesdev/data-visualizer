# data-visualizer

A website that displays a visualization of various datasets. The country and continent population data originates from [Worldometer's population counter](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population). The GDP data originates from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org)'s nominal and per capita GDP data from 2017. The flag icons are inspired by [Emojious's flag icon collection](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/flags-37). Many of the icons have been created or altered by [@zznith](https://github.com/zznith) and I. Use the arrow keys to switch between datasets.
